## Dynamic Environments

Several environments are emerging, all with *high dynamic properties*: 

* Internet of Things - with e.g. *the dynamic discovery and adaptation to different hardware*
* Smart Cities - with e.g. *the dynamic trafic and energy management*
* Smart Buildings and Houses - with e.g. *the dynamic user-adapted light and heating control*
* Vehicular Networks - with e.g. *the dynamic, autonomic driveless guidance*
* Cloud Computing - with e.g. *the dynamic provisioning and load-balancing service management*.

## Hot Research Topics

We concentrate on the software development process, especially on designing **[Middleware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware)**, including programming languages, virtual machines and service-oriented architectures to tackle *- at run time-* the dynamic nature of these environments:

* Adaptive Virtual Machines
  * Performant
  * Multi-tenant
  * Embedded
  * Run-time Evolving
* Autonomous Distributed Architectures and Algorithms
  * Self-* (Healing, Organizing)
  * Scalable
  * Long-life Living
* Context-aware Domain Specific Languages
  * Context-aware Primitives
  * Heterogeneous Hardware|Software-specialization
* Run-time Verification
  * Formal Description Discovery 
  * Run-time Checking, Monitoring, Negotiation, Substitution
