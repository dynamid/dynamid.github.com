The current state of our research on the [JooFlux project](https://github.com/dynamid/jooflux)
was presented last week at the [ComPAS 2013 conference](http://compas2013.inrialpes.fr).

Our research paper was published in the 
[CFSE track](http://compas2013.inrialpes.fr/cfp/systeme-cfse) that gathers the French
specialists in the larger field of operating systems.

Lots of positive feedback on our works, we couldn't be happier!

Here are the slides, in French:
