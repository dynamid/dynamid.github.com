[Julien Ponge](http://julien.ponge.info/) wrote an article called
["Demystifying invokedynamic"](http://www.oraclejavamagazine-digital.com/javamagazine/20130102#pg50)
for the latest edition of Oracle Java Magazine (free subscription).

The article is a gentle introduction to `invokedynamic`, the addition to the Java virtual machine
for improving the implementation of dynamic languages on top of the JVM.

Last but not least, it was reviewed by [Marcus Lagergren](https://twitter.com/lagergren) of JRockit 
fame who currently works on [Nashorn](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/nashorn/).
