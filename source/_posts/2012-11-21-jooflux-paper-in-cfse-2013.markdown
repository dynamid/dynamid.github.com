We are glad to report that our first peer-reviewed scientific paper
for [JooFlux](http://github.com/dynamid/jooflux) has been accepted
in the [CFSE 2013 conference](http://compas2013.inrialpes.fr).

CFSE is the top French national conference on operating system research. The program committee
comprises big names in the field, the kind with proven research and industrial track records, so
this is definitely a strong achievement for DynaMid.

Our next-step is to take the thoroughly-detailed reviews that we obtained and target a top
international conference.
