The DynaMid group unveiled [Golo](http://golo-lang.org/) last week at the [Devoxx France 2013 conference](http://www.devoxx.fr/).

Golo is a new dynamic language for the Java virtual machine that takes advantage of `invokedynamic`.
It is lightweight and runs *fast*.

Golo will be useful to us for playing with language extensions. It provides us with a stronger JVM expertise within
the DynaMid group. Of course Golo is far from being feature-complete, and we will keep pushing on the development front.

More details regarding Golo:

* [try the language from a web browser on Google AppEngine](http://golo-console.appspot.com/)
* [Golo on GitHub](https://github.com/golo-lang/golo-lang)

* [the original release announcement](http://golo-lang.org/news/2013/03/27/golo-opensourced/)

Golo is made available under the permissive Apache Software Licence version 2.0, and you are highly encouraged to try it and participate!

We are looking forward to hearing what you will do with Golo.
