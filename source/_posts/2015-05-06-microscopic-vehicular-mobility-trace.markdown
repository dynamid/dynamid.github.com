Understanding the dynamics of vehicles is a major issue in smart cities 
evolution. Most intelligent transportation systems concentrate on macro-
mobility with centralized decisions and global optimizations for whole 
cities. With the great development of autonomous cars and vehicle-to-vehicule 
communication systems, micro-mobility is again of special importance for 
opportunistic data dissemination and local decisions - for instance when 
arriving at traffic lights or when vehicles meet.

Simulation tools are widely used to evaluate assumption correctness and 
performances of optimization algorithms. Several macroscopic vehicular 
mobility trace exist, but few detailed ones at the microscopic level. Most of 
macro traces integrate simplistic models for intersections and roundabout, 
while the complexity of this fine-grained mobility can greatly affect the 
global optimization. For that purpose, we propose a dataset describing a 
complex roundabout in Creteil, France.

Great job by Marie-Ange who coordinates this \#JointWork between INSA-Lyon,
VALEO Group and Val-de-Marne Region !
