[Roya Golchay](http://dynamid.citi-lab.fr/people/) will present preliminary ideas
of her PhD work in the [CFSE 2013 conference](http://compas2013.inrialpes.fr).

CFSE is the top French national conference on operating system research. The program 
committee comprises big names in the field, and we hope many interesting discussions
over coffee about the poster.
