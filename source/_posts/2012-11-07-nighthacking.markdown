DynaMid member [Julien Ponge](http://julien.ponge.info/) recorded a
[NightHacking session with Stephen Chin from Oracle](http://steveonjava.com/nighthacking/).

Stephen was doing a tour of Europe before ending at the [Devoxx conference](http://www.devoxx.com/).
He had a stop in Lyon and the [LyonJUG](http://www.lyonjug.org) arranged the interview.

During the 1 hour informal discussion, Julien talked about bytecode manipulation on the JVM
and even demoed [JooFlux](https://github.com/dynamid/jooflux) at one point.
