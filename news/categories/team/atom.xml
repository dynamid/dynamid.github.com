    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year, the Dynamid team welcomes 4 new members!</p>

<p>Mark Little joins the team as Visiting Professor. Mark is CTO at RedHat and Professor at Newcastle University. With a deep background in transactional distributed systems, Mark pictures future middlewares as adaptive and evolving with core functionalites integrating IoT devices. Sharing the same vision, let's start a close collaboration - still with an open-source issue !</p>

<p><a href="http://jilles.dibangoye.net">Jilles Dibangoye</a> is recruited as Associate Professor. Jilles obtained a PhD at Laval University (Quebec City, Canada) and University of Caen (France). His research interests span the areas of single and multi-agent systems, optimal and approximate mathematical optimization techniques, statistics and machine learning, control and game theories.</p>

<p>Fabrice Jumel and Jacques Saraydaryan, Associate Professors at CPE Lyon, join the team. With backgrounds in embedded systems and security, they developed a new expertise in robotic platform. They participated to 2014 edition of the RoboCup and won the 3rd place in the Robocup@work category.</p>

<p>Welcome on board!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Olivier Simonin and Jan Faigl will organize in August 18th, 2014, at Prague the <a href="http://robotics.fel.cvut.cz/macorex14/">Workshop on Multi-Agent Coordination in Robotic Exploration</a>.
Robotic exploration is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics that addresses one of the most challenging application scenarios to provide an efficient approach to collect information about an unknown environment. There are many motivational scenarios for practical deployment of mobile robots and probably even more approaches promising benefits from deploying several mobile robots. However, what are the real performance guarantees of the modern sophisticated exploration strategies? Do the novel methods and experimental demonstrations provide qualitatively better results in a new principle way or are these improvement only the results of a better tuning for the particular platforms and scenarios? What is the bridge between algorithmic complexity and robotic limitations? How to define scalable solutions?</p>

<p>The goal of the workshop is to foster a discussion about approaches and paradigms studied in artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-agent system (MAS) communities with the robotic limitations and requirements arising from their practical deployment in multi-robot exploration. In particular, the workshop is intended to explore the aforementioned questions within the context of the following scientific challenges:</p>

<ul>
<li>How balancing algorithmic (MAS) complexity and robotics limitation?</li>
<li>How to measure performance in multi-robot exploration?</li>
<li>How to facilitate the robotic deployment of AI strategies?</li>
<li>What are the robotic limitations needed to be considered in the exploration strategies?</li>
<li>What are the multi-robot benchmarks allowing qualitative and quantitative comparisons?</li>
<li>What is the niche of multi-agent coordination mechanisms and capabilities of nowadays multi-robot systems?</li>
</ul>
